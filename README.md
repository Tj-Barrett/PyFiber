PyFiber is in development as a side project

PyFiber is a visualization tool used to manually determine the percent crystallinity of polymer films and fibers from XRD rather than through tools such as Jade or PDXL. 

PyFiber takes a variety of inputs, and the GUI can be modified in the INI file. Data should be presented with column 1 being the two theta value, and column 2 the intensity. Some formats from Rigaku software are supported, with more planned as time allows.
